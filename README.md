## Overview
In Thailand, for every 2 million receiving mental health care, up to 10 million struggle silently—five times the visible number.* Stress is often unspoken, with many lacking a safe space to express their worries. Young people, in particular, may feel their stress is dismissed and remain unaware of how to seek help. This hidden burden profoundly affects their health, productivity, and overall well-being.

Inspired by the Thai sentiment, 'When stressed, I just want to sit and relax by the sea,' OceanSpace offers a digital escape to the calming and expansive ocean. OceanSpace provides a safe, confidential, and comforting sanctuary where users can find relief from stress. By exploring features deeply connected with Thai culture, we offer a soothing break from the pressures of everyday life, creating personalized and engaging experiences tailored to Thai users.

The Typhoon Hackathon 2024, organized by SCBX Group and SCB 10X, is a prestigious event centered on developing innovative AI solutions to enhance the use and representation of the Thai language and culture.
